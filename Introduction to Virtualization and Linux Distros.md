3) Create box for centos 9 give 2GB Ram, 20GB HDD size and give 2 cpu for this box and up your server

I created 2 VM using VMware which both run CentOS 9. One is a GUI installation and the other is Minimal. Later on I Connected to both VMs using SSH protocol and application called TERMIUS

4) Research about what is virtualization and why we use Vmware!

Virtualization is creating something virtual like an OS that uses separate hardware pieces for running that OS. We can create an OS and give it a part of our computer’s hardware, so that it will not bother with our own hardware and run separately from it. This way we can run multiple OS, storage, server, etc. from our one computer. VMware is a tool for doing this in an easy way.

5) Read about Linux distros and write below down

Linux is a kernel that we can create our own Operating systems. With Linux Kernel we can add packages and then create our Operating systems which suits our needs. These operating systems often called Distros. Most popular Linux Distros are UBUNTU, ARCHLINUX, REDHAT, CENTOS, etc.

6) What is differences between RHEL and Centos

RHEL is shorten of RedHat Enterprise Linux which is a distro of Linux Created by RedHat Co.. CentOS is also a distro which stands for Community Enterprise Operating System. CentOS is in a rough free version of RHEL because RHEL is paid OS.

7) Linux Distros is open-sources read about open-sources

Open Source means that we can copy, investigate and use that software freely. Open Source softwares is completely open for interaction. We can dive to their root system and do whatever we want

8) What is it Kernel (Read and write below down). 

 Kernel is system software of operating system creates connection between applications and computer hardware. It is the software that connects to computer hardware directly when the computer runs.
